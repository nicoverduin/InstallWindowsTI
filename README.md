## Installing TI C/C++ environment for 1st and 2nd year students

***<u>Prerequisites</u>***

To allow the installation to run smoothly, the following software needs to be installed:

a) Python 3.7.7 or 3.7.8 (see [https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-377/)](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-377/))
b) 7-zip (see: [https://www.7-zip.org/download.html](https://www.7-zip.org/download.html))
c) Git desktop (see: [https://desktop.github.com/)](https://desktop.github.com/))

Install the software in their default **c:\program files** directories. **Do not install elsewhere** or the installation will not work.

After installation of prerequisites reboot your system to ensure correct path names

<u>***Installation***</u>

Create a directory on any drive (preferably in the root i.e. D:\HUSoftware).  To avoid problems create the folder name without spaces.

Open CMD (through the search bar in Windows) and go to the created directory

Type in (without the quotes “git clone [https://github.com/nicoverduin/InstallWindowsTI.git](https://github.com/nicoverduin/InstallWindowsTI.git) .” (don’t forget the dot just before the double quote) and press the  <ENTER> key.

If you type dir <ENTER> there should be a file installsoftware.py.

Next type “python.exe installsoftware.py” (again without the quotes) and press the <ENTER> key

If all goes well you will be asked once to allow a change through regedit. Accept it with yes!!

Reboot your system

<u>***Using CodeLite***</u>

You can now use your software. Using CodeLite you can open the workspace in OOPC-examples, V2CSPE1-Examples, V2CSPE2-Examples and V2THDE-Examples.
